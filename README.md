# Mario Game

## Description
The Mario Game is a web-based game that replicates the classic T-Rex Runner gaming experience you often find in web browsers when there's no internet connection. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide an interactive and enjoyable gameplay experience.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML:** The structure of the game is built using HTML.
- **CSS:** CSS is used for styling the game elements, making it visually appealing.
- **JavaScript:** JavaScript is responsible for the game's logic, including character movement, enemy behavior, and collision detection.
